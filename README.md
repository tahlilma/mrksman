# MRKSMAN
A discord bot that keeps track of the latest deleted/edited message in a server. I dont host it publicly so if you want to use it in your own server set it up yourself. 

## Setup
The setup is farily simple and it only involves creating a `.env` file in the root of the project and populating it with the following.
```
TOKEN=your discord bot token here
PREFIX=a single symbol or letter prefix
```
**PARAMS ARE CASE SENSITIVE**

After you are done with that you can just start the bot up with
```
npm run start
```

Make changes to the bot in the case you feel like you need custom functionality. PR's are welcome.
